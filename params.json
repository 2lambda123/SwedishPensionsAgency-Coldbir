{"name":"Coldbir","tagline":"Column database in R","body":"The Coldbir package is a column-oriented DBMS in R.\r\n\r\nThe project is currently maintained by Thomas Reinholdsson (<reinholdsson@gmail.com>).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUse `devtools` for easy installation\r\n\r\n    devtools::install_github('Coldbir', 'SthlmR', 'v0.3')\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure to load the package with `library(Coldbir)`.\r\n\r\nThen the next step is to decide where the database is to be saved, or where it already exists:\r\n\r\n    a <- cdb('database_path')\r\n\r\nTo save data to the database one simply write:\r\n\r\n    a['foo'] <- 1:10\r\n\r\nand to get the variable:\r\n\r\n    b <- a['foo']\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to put a data frame to the coldbir database - each column will then represent one variable each;\r\n\r\n    a[] <- MASS::survey\r\n\r\nHowever, since they are all saved as variables one cannot get all of them back at once. Their names are the same as their previous column names. For example:\r\n\r\n    b <- a['Pulse']\r\n\r\n### Data types\r\n\r\nCurrently supported data types:\r\n\r\n- `integer`\r\n- `double`\r\n- `logical`\r\n- `factor`\r\n- `Date`\r\n- `POSIXct` / `POSIXlt`\r\n\r\n### Variable documentation\r\n\r\nAn additional feature is to add documentation to a variable. \r\n\r\nCreate an object of the `doc` class and add it to a variable:\r\n\r\n    a['foo'] <- doc(\r\n          'Foo' = 'This is a variable', \r\n          'Info' = list(\r\n            'Stats' = paste('The minimum value is', min(1:10)),\r\n            'Source' = \"Some db\"\r\n            )\r\n          )\r\n\r\n*As one may notice, the doc object is build up as a list. Thus it makes it possible to e.g. include variable statistics that updates automatically.* \r\n\r\nTo get the documentation (as a list):\r\n\r\n    d <- get_doc(a, \"foo\")\r\n\r\n    d$Info$Stats\r\n    # [1] \"The minimum value is 1\"\r\n\r\n### File structure\r\n\r\nThe coldbir database consists of folders where each folder represent a variable. \r\nEach variable may have several dimensions, e.g. months and years. \r\nThe data is stored as a [column-oriented DBMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS). \r\nBelow is an example of a database, named *mydb*, with a couple of variables:\r\n\r\n    mydb/\r\n      income/\r\n        data/\r\n          d[2011].cdb.gz\r\n          d[2012].cdb.gz\r\n        doc.json\r\n        lookup.txt\r\n        readme.md\r\n      unemployment/\r\n        data/\r\n          d[2011].cdb.gz\r\n          d[2012].cdb.gz\r\n        doc.json\r\n        lookup.txt\r\n        readme.md\r\n\r\nThe `doc.json` includes the variable documentation that is read with `get_doc()` method. `readme.md` includes the same information but in markdown.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Example: Survey data\r\n\r\n#### Write data and documentation\r\n\r\nLink to database\r\n\r\n    a <- cdb()\r\n\r\nAdd survey data to database\r\n\r\n    require(MASS)\r\n    a[\"Age\"] <- survey$Age\r\n    a[\"Pulse\"] <- survey$Pulse\r\n\r\nAdd documentation for `Age` and `Pulse`\r\n\r\n    a[\"Age\"] <- doc(\r\n        title = \"Age\",\r\n        description = \"Age of the student in years.\"\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    a[\"Pulse\"] <- doc(\r\n        title = \"Pulse\",\r\n        description = \"Pulse rate of student (beats per minute).\"\r\n        )\r\n        \r\n#### How to use\r\n\r\nScatter plot\r\n\r\n    plot(a[\"Age\"], a[\"Pulse\"],\r\n         xlab = get_doc(a, \"Age\")$description, \r\n         ylab = get_doc(a, \"Pulse\")$description\r\n         )\r\n\r\nHistogram\r\n\r\n    d <- get_doc(a, \"Pulse\")\r\n    hist(a[\"Pulse\"], main = paste(\"Histogram of\", d$title), xlab = d$title, sub = d$description)\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nThe *master* branch is the development branch, and might therefore be a bit instable. Stable releases are marked with tags, e.g. v1.0, where the first number represents a new stable release and the second number imply new bug fixes within the given release version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nColdbir is licensed under the AGPLv3, the terms of which are included in the file LICENSE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
