{"name":"Coldbir","tagline":"Column database in R","body":"The Coldbir package is a column-oriented DBMS in R.\r\n\r\nThe project is currently maintained by Thomas Reinholdsson (<reinholdsson@gmail.com>).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nUse `devtools` for easy installation\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github('Coldbir', 'SthlmR', 'v0.2')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure to load the package with `library(Coldbir)`.\r\n\r\nThen the next step is to decide where the database is to be saved, or where it already exists:\r\n\r\n```r\r\na <- cdb('database_path')\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo save data to the database one simply write:\r\n\r\n```r\r\na['foo'] <- 1:10\r\n```\r\n\r\nand to get the variable it is just to use:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nb <- a['foo']\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to put a data frame to the coldbir database - each column will then represent one variable each;\r\n\r\n```r\r\na[] <- MASS::survey\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, since they are all saved as variables one cannot get all of them back at once. Their names are the same as their previous column names. For example:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nb <- a['Pulse']\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Data types\r\n\r\nCurrently supported data types are:\r\n\r\n- `integer`\r\n- `double`\r\n- `logical`\r\n- `factor`\r\n- `Date` (v0.3)\r\n- `POSIX*t` (v0.3)\r\n\r\nThe `POSIXct` timestamps are automatically converted to and saved in `GMT`; \r\nhence when read from disk it will be represented in the same format. \r\n`POSIXlt`, on the other hand, is also saved as `GMT` but is converted to and represented in the local timezone.\r\n\r\nDue to timezones one has to be really careful when using dates and timestamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n### File structure\r\n\r\nThe coldbir database consists of folders where each folder represent a variable. \r\nEach variable may have several dimensions, e.g. months and years. \r\nThe data is stored as a [column-oriented DBMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS). \r\nBelow is an example of a database, named *mydb*, with a couple of variables:\r\n\r\n    mydb/\r\n      income/\r\n        data/\r\n          d[2011].cdb.gz\r\n          d[2012].cdb.gz\r\n        lookup.txt\r\n        readme.md\r\n      unemployment/\r\n        data/\r\n          d[2011].cdb.gz\r\n          d[2012].cdb.gz\r\n        lookup.txt\r\n        readme.md\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\nThe *master* branch is the development branch, and might therefore be a bit instable. Stable releases are marked with tags, e.g. v1.0, where the first number represents a new stable release and the second number imply new bug fixes within the given release version.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nColdbir is licensed under the AGPLv3, the terms of which are included in the file LICENSE.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
