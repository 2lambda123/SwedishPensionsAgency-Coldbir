{"name":"coldbir","tagline":"a tasty column database in R","google":"","body":"## Installation\r\n\r\nUse `devtools` for easy installation\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github('coldbir', 'SthlmR')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure to load the package with `library(coldbir)`.\r\n\r\nThen the next step is to decide where the database is to be saved, or where it already exists:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndb <- coldbir:::db$new('my_path')\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo save data to the database one simply use `put_v`:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nvariable <- 1:10\r\ndb$put_v(variable)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand to get the variable it just to use `get_v`:\r\n\r\n```r\r\na <- db$get_v('variable')\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to put a data frame to the coldbir database - each column will then represent one variable each.\r\nOnce again, make use of `put_v`:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nvariables <- MASS::survey\r\ndb$put_v(variables)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, since they are all saved as variables one cannot get all of them back at once. \r\nUse `get_v` to get them back. Their names are the same as their previous column names. For example:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nb <- db$get_v('Pulse')\r\n```\r\n    \r\nThis was an quick introduction to coldbir. More to come soon.\r\n\r\n### File structure\r\n\r\nThe coldbir database consists of folders where each folder represent a variable. \r\nEach variable may have several dimensions, e.g. months and years. \r\nThe data is stored as a [column-oriented DBMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS). \r\nBelow is an example of a database, named *mydb*, with a couple of variables:\r\n\r\n    mydb/\r\n      income/\r\n        data/\r\n          income[2011].cdb.gz\r\n          income[2012].cdb.gz\r\n        LOOKUP.txt\r\n        README.md\r\n      unemployment/\r\n        data/\r\n          unemployment[2011].cdb.gz\r\n          unemployment[2012].cdb.gz\r\n        LOOKUP.txt\r\n        README.md\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nThe project is currently maintained by Thomas Reinholdsson (<reinholdsson@gmail.com>).","note":"Don't delete this file!
